# MD5-Anti-Virus-Framework
Framework for creating a MD5 based anti-virus, has GUI. Written in Python 3. It gets a list of bad hashes, runs selected file(s) trough the list inside of the "badhashes.txt" file. Use this for any of your projects i don't mind, although credit would be nice it is not required. The whole source is python, compressed with WinRAR.
